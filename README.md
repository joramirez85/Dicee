# Dicee

Dicee is game where the user can roll and change dices, usin the views: UIButton, UIImageView, UIImage and importing assets.

The goal for this project is to learn how to link our design with our code using IBOutlet and IBAction.

In this project we can learn how to create and use variables and constants, also an array and how to create a function and use it, as "Principle DRY - Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself". 

Finally we can learn how to engage the motion sensors in the iPhone, for example shaking the iPhone to roll and change their dice faces

# How to test out the shake gesture in the Simulator?

Of course you can't shake your Mac :) that would be crazy

Instead you should go into "Hardware -> Shake Gesture"
